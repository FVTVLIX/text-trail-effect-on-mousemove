# text-trail-effect-on-mousemove

## Description

I'm testing out some new effects with the mouse cursor. This project is displaying a trail effect on mouse move with my initials. This was all done with vanilla javascript. This can be done with images as well, not just text. Obviously, this is not responsive..
